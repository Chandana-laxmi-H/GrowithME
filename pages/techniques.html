			<h1>Seed Saving</h1>
		</strong>
		<p>To save seed is to participate in the process of natural selection. If you save seed only from the biggest
			tomato of the bunch and replant them year after year, you’ll eventually end up with seeds that produce
			plants on which all the tomatoes are bigger. The same holds true for almost any other trait. Want tomatoes
			that ripen earlier? Save seed from the first fruits to ripen each year. Want disease resistant plants? Then
			definitely don’t save seed from those that are disease-infested. This is essentially what professional plant
			breeders do. You don’t need to get too scientific about it, but as a rule of thumb, only save seed from your
			healthiest, most robust, tastiest plants.</p>

		<h4>Seeds of some plants are easier to save than others</h4>
		<P>Seeds are the products of pollination, the botanical version of sex. Some crops are self-pollinators, which
			means individual plants are fertilized by their own pollen. These crops, including beans, peas, tomatoes,
			peppers, and cauliflower, are among the easiest to save because you don’t need special botanical knowledge
			to ensure that the seeds grow out true-to-type.</P>

		<h4>Seeds are'nt viable until fully ripe </h4>
		<p>
			Just like picking the perfect tomato, you have to wait until seed is fully ripe before you harvest it – if
			picked from the plant too soon, the seed will not germinate. As explained above, optimal seed maturity is
			usually later than optimal crop maturity. Bean and pea seeds are not ready until the pod is brown, dry, and
			beginning to split open. This is true of any seed that grows in a pod, which includes most greens. Corn seed
			should be allowed to dry on the cob in the field. Some vegetables, including cucumbers and eggplant, should
			not be picked for seed until they are overripe and beginning to shrivel up and rot.</p>

			<h1>Coir-Leaves-Soil Technique</h1>
		</strong>
		<p>
			It is taken for granted that we need soil to grow healthy plants! However, what if we could grow vibrant
			plants of all kinds, without soil? This phenomenon of gardening sans soil is being adopted by more and more
			people and involves using substitutes instead of soil to grow plants in a thriving environment.

			Soil-less gardening is an ideal solution for those who want to start a kitchen garden, but do not have
			access to fresh, healthy soil. It also allows us to make use of gravel, coconut husks, and more to innovate
			gardening like never before. It also completely removes the need for pesticides of any kind, as the mixture
			itself is sterile. Here is how you can make use of unconventional materials to make your own soil-less mix!

		<div ><p>The above images is a step by step approach to a Coir-Leaves-Soil Technique where the botton layer of the
			pot/grow bags are filled with coconut coir upto 2-3inches.Coir used in soil blends helps retain water, while
			allowing for sufficient drainage and aeration. It promotes strong root and top growth with a plant-friendly
			pH and the capacity to hold nutrients. It is disease free, pest free and weed free. Coir is a great
			substitute for peat in the garden; it has similar qualities, but as a by-product of the food industry and a
			readily renewable resource, it is environmentally friendly.</p>
		<p>
			The middle layer of the grow bags are piled up with the crumbled dry leaves upon the coir layer.Composting
			dry leaves or using this simple techniques to grow plants directly in this method make a dark, rich, earthy,
			organic matter that can become a substitute to soil. It adds nutrients to the
			garden soil and the larger particle size helps enhance the tilth and then loosen compacted earth.

			<h1>Home fertilizers</h1>
		</strong>
		<h3>Coffee Grounds</h3>
		<p>Coffee grounds come with a lot of uses, but one of their best is as a fertilizer. Lots of plants, such as
			blueberries, rhododendron, roses, and tomatoes, thrive best in acidic soil. Recycle your coffee grounds
			to help acidify your soil. There are a couple of ways to do this— you can either top dress by sprinkling
			the used grounds over the surface of the soil, or you can make “coffee” to pour on your gardens. Soak up
			to six cups of used coffee grounds for up to a week to make garden coffee, then use it to water your
			acid-loving plants.</p>
		<h3>Eggshells</h3>
		<p>If you’ve ever used lime on your garden, then you know it comes with lots of benefits — chiefly, it helps
			lower the acidity of your soil for plants that don’t like acid, and it provides plants with lots of calcium,
			which is an essential nutrient. Lime itself is an all-natural fertilizer that you can buy at the garden
			center, but if you’d rather save some money, there is a cheaper way to get the same benefits. Simply wash
			out the eggshells from your kitchen, save them, and crush them to use in your garden. It turns out that
			eggshells are 93% calcium carbonate, which is the scientific name for lime.</p>
		<h3>Banana Peels</h3>
		<p>We eat bananas for their potassium, and roses love potassium too. Simply bury peels in a hole alongside the
			rose bush so they can compost naturally. As the rose grows, bury the peels into the soil’s top layer. Both
			of these approaches will provide much-needed potassium for the plant’s proper growth.</p>
